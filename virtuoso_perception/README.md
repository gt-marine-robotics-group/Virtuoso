## Virtuoso Perception

The perception stack uses Autoware.auto to handle euclidean clustering. It also uses euclidean clustering to detect where buoys are located. Currently, work
is being done on integrating camera data with euclidean clustering to classify the buoys (which is needed for task 3). When that is completed, this documentation 
will be improved substantially.
